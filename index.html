      Some things that I am looking foward to is hanging out with my friends again on a more regular basis and watching the new release of the playstation 5 wich I have een wwaitning on for a while. Some other things that I have been looking foward on is traveling to brazil to see my family, most of myfamily is from Brazil and I have not been to Brazil ever, so hopefully soon I can go and visit my family over there, I also am looking foward to my college classes this summer because I am going to do them with my friend so it will be easy for both of us because we will have each other in the same class to do work and get help.
