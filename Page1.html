One thing that I am especially excited about is doing college classes this summer because I will be getting ahead in terms of my education and also I will have the same classes as my friends so the classes will be fun and easier to get through because my friends will be there with me so we can get work done faster the class work will be easier to complete and we can help each other if we get stuck on something which will probably happen and in the end we will be hanging out with each other which is always better that doing it alone.
