          Another thing that I am the most excited about is that soon I will be going to visit my family and be embraced my culture in Brazil. Most of my family lives in Brazil I am one of very few families that branched out to come and live in North America. I am excited to experience the Music, events and especially the food because I love Brazilian cuisine, and I can't wait to experience all of this for myself when I visit there and hopefully I will be able to soon.
